Project Name :- Bike Sharing Assignment

Here, we will be analyzing the data of US bike provider BoomBikes and will be performing Linear Regression on the dataset to find out important insights and inferences.

General Information :-

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
We will be using days.csv data for analysis

Summary :-

Below is the summary of the algorithm

Equation :- cnt = 0.23*yr + 0.06*workingday + 0.05*aug + 0.05*oct + 0.11*sep + 0.07*sat + 0.1*summer + 0.11*winter + 0.5*temp - 0.16*windspeed - 0.04*jan - 0.302*lightSnow - 0.08*mistCloudy + 0.09

Summary :-

    1. Train dataset R^2 == 0.847
    2. Train dataset adjusted R^2 == 0.844
    3. Test dataset R^2 == 0.747
    4. Test dataset adjusted R^2 == 0.722
